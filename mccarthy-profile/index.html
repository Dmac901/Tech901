                    <p>I am a Tech901 student focused on learning new skills. I have recently graduated from the Tech901's Data Analytics class and have an interest in learning more about Web Programming. I am looking to pick up new skills and certifications as enter into the IT world. Web Programming is the next class offered. I would be excited to join everyone in the Summer 2024 Class. </p>
                    <p>If I were to discuss my superpower, it would most certainly be defenstration. While it is a very unusual superpower, it is one that Microsoft Windows does not support; it never has. I feel my superpower ebb and flow as I dive into the Tron world to shatter my own glass ceiling with marketable job skills. I've already deleted my recycle bin once and for all. Microsoft would have me cease and desist at registry editing but developing my superpowers will help me prevail in our modern digital world in ways I can only imagine. Defenstration is also about getting beyond the pane of a computer screen. It is simply throwing things out of a window, even myself. Hello World!</p>
